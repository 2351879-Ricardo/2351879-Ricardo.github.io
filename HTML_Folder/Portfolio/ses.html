    <h2>Space Evasion Solo</h2>
    <p>Space Evasion Solo is shooter game developed by me.</p>
    <p>
      Similar to the game asteroids, you aim to survive by navigating your ship
      away from asteroids and/or shooting them. The longer you survive, the more
      points you gain. You also gain points from shooting asteroids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is an in-browser version of the game. Please feel free to try it
      out.

      If you wish to try a more stable and less buggy version, I recommend you
      download the build from my GitHub repository. These builds are for windows
      computers.
