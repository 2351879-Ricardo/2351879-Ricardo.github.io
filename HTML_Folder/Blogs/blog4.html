    <h2>What Interactivity Means On The WWW</h2>
    <p>
      "Towards a Study of Information Geographies" is a reading that I found
      highlighted well the consideration of access to information online and the
      general control of information in the world. It also further highlights
      how information is manipulated and controlled via power relations and
      access to said information.
    </p>
    <h3>(Im)mutable Augmentations</h3>
    <p>
      The reading points out that information on the internet can be considered
      as (im)mutable, highlighting the fact that it is both mutable and
      immutable. This can be clearly seen in our daily lives with how
      information is presented as well as who has access to said information -
      as well as who is in charge of distributing the information. If wanted,
      people could keep information immutable by having no further effect on the
      information (in terms of things such as editing) to provide a concise and
      unchanged form of media. However, this clearly leaves room for the
      information to be mutable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this day and age, the ability to edit, change and adapt information is
      becoming more apparent. A simple and rather simplistic example can be seen
      in Twitter's goal of making tweets able to be edited. Not only is
      information tending to be able to be more mutable in the physical sense,
      but is also reliant on change due to how people interpret said information
      as well as how information is presented to the reader. This point will
      further be discussed in the accessibility and power dynamic of information
      in later sections.
    </p>
    <h3>Controlling the Information</h3>
    <p>
      The reading points out that even before the information era, news and the
      spread of information were more prominent in the Northern territories and
      nearly inexistent in the Southern territories. This is directly related to
      the influence of power on an international level, as well as who is in
      charge of providing information. Information provided is also varied and
      hence reliant on the geological location. This can be seen in basically
      any country, as seen mainly with propaganda in wars. The government and
      people of power will only relay information that is beneficial to them,
      varying information from geological locations dependent on circumstances
      in the area.
    </p>
    <h3>Access to Information</h3>
    <p>
      While people like to point out there has been a betterment in the
      spreading of information as well as the access to it, it is still a
      prominent problem where there is unequal access. This stems from big
      corporations in all sectors. For a relative comparison, I will be using an
      example of the gaming industry. While people are able to access game
      servers from across the globe, people in foreign areas are less advantaged
      and have less impact on the system. This can be seen from examples such as
      the lack of game servers in South Africa. Another example is that if the
      server's conditions were to change in the host area (for example an
      American game server), regardless of other gaming communities from varying
      locations, the control of the server and how it changes is purely reliant
      on America. If they were to shut down the servers, it would be in regard
      to them and not taking into consideration other foreign communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      This point further highlights the power imbalance still apparent in
      society. Just like times of old, the North still dominates with access and
      control to information. This is directly related to the already existing
      technologies as well as the vast differences in advancements in
      technologies between areas. As such, naturally, the North will still
      dominate.
    </p>
    <h3>A Move Towards Proper Mutability</h3>
    <p>
      Even still now, information is controlled by big corporations. Information
      is hard to change when provided by large corporations and it is hard to
      alter information and have fair equal access. In my personal opinion, the
      advancements towards open-source technologies is a step in the right
      direction, as information is fully accessible and changeable by the full
      community, able to be customized to specific parties.
