    <h2>Analysis of my UI & UX</h2>
    <p>
      While I have never been classified as “good” in the artistic view of
      things (this ranging from the creation of visual art, the theory, and
      making things that look visually appealing), it has become apparent that
      UI and UX are elements that touch both in the field of aesthetic and
      functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it is better to have components on my website that are visually
      appealing, the creation and effects of my current UI and UX are still very
      reliant on their technical aspect.
    </p>
    <p>So, what exactly is happening with my UI and UX?</p>
    <h3>The Idea Behind UI & UX</h3>
    <p>
      The design of UI & UX is not made for the creator. As the abbreviation
      implies, this design aspect of any project is centralized around the
      consumers ("users") who will be interacting with said product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting with a simple definition to work with and to investigate the UI &
      UX, I will be borrowing the wording by Marc Hassenzahl and Noam
      Tractinsky: "The term 'user experience' is associated with a variety of
      meanings ... " "ranging from traditional usability to beauty, hedonic,
      affective or experiential aspects of technology use." [1].
    </p>
    <p>
      From this definition, it can be concluded the world of UI and UX is not
      something that focuses on one specific aspect of design, but rather on the
      appearance and functionality of the full product, how it works together,
      and most importantly how the user views, interprets and interacts with
      said product. Baring this in mind, a brief breakdown of my current
      website's UI and UX will follow.
    </p>
    <h3>My UI & UX</h3>
    <h4>Clarity and Concision</h4>
    <p>
      Since my website is aimed to have a minimalistic feel, the need for many
      flashy components is unnecessary and often leads me to create only
      necessary elements. That is also to say that it isn’t perfect either. I
      like to think that the clarity and concision of my website are quite high.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the home page, the user is met with a little greeting message with
      few other options available. This design is apparent across my entire
      website with few options of interactivity, currently limited to the nav
      bar which takes you exactly to where it says.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where concision breaks however are when going to pages such as design and
      blogs. Since these are components that have many sub-articles and
      information blocks, they expand across a long area, which breaks the
      feeling of minimalism. To find specific blogs, users are forced to scroll
      through all predeceasing blogs in full without the ability to quickly
      switch between them. This has been noted and is in the development of
      being reworked into a method such that users can navigate across
      information areas quicker.
    </p>
    <h4>Interactivity</h4>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, the theme for my website is that of a clean,
      minimalistic feel. This approach however has left me only with the
      navigation bar as a directly interactable part of my website. This is
      problematic as it limits interactivity between the user and leaves users
      with a more static feel to the website. This is also being worked on and
      is linked directly to the mentioned problem above regarding the blogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fitt’s Law is a law that states the time required for a user to navigate
      across elements on a page is directly affected by the size of the element
      as well as the distance from said element [2]. This use brought upon the
      use of larger buttons, however, seems to not have appeared on my website.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be seen as a direct flaw as buttons on the navigation bar are
      fairly small and packed quite closely together. This unintentionally
      allows for possible user mis-inputs as well as a general less appealing UI
      and UX to the website. This should be alleviated by changes in the sizes
      and spacing of the buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following on the topic of the navigation bar, the concept of convention
      can now also be brought up. The idea of convention can be seen as the
      “shared practices” [3] adopted by the design community of any project. The
      navigation bar on my website makes use of a border element with a white
      background to show different options on it. However, this isn’t a button
      but rather a text link. This breaks convention on many levels as it not
      only raises questions as to why it isn’t a button, but also the “button”
      not working as intended. This can be easily seen by hovering within the
      white-bordered area while not on the text and not being able to click on
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This also directly then links to the idea of the “Norman Door” [4] and how
      information displayed can be misleading – referred to more casually as a
      bad door. In visual appearance, it would seem that this is a button,
      should act as a button, and should navigate like one, however, is not and
      may confuse users. As such, this is another primary fix that needs to be
      taken place.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Overall the website takes a nice, minimalist can concise feel as intended.
      It can be seen there are obvious changes that should be made regarding
      bettering the UI and UX (such as the long blogs page and the deceptive
      navigation bar). Breaking down the visual aesthetic, it is also apparent
      that the footer doesn’t fit well with the pages and should be either
      redesigned or have contained information moved to another place.
