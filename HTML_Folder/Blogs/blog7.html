    <h2>My Website's Journey</h2>
    <p>
      The design process for this website has been of great experience. This
      blog aims to compress my experience, understanding and outcomes for the
      website and its creation process.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great takeaway from this experience is the reminder that one shouldn’t
      be too adamant about one specific design choice. Originally, I had planned
      for my website to have a top-bar navigation system, but that would change
      once the screen size became small enough. While I liked this idea, after
      having over 10 people try and use my sight, it proved to me that the first
      choice is not always the correct choice and/or the best choice. After
      receiving feedback, my design for the website changed into one that is
      easier to comprehend and easier to use. This further raises the point that
      one should be fluid in their design, adjusting it according to feedback,
      conventions and ways that are easier for others to understand as opposed
      to just a “cool” idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back on my progress, it is clear that my understanding of web
      design, as well as the languages used (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), have
      greatly improved. Since this was the first time I had been properly
      working with these languages, it took a while for me to fully understand
      the concepts. After investigation, research and experience, my code and
      layout have improved. This includes the focus on encapsulation and process
      isolation, aiming to keep core functionality together, allowing for
      changes to occur in one place. This not only allows for easier-to-read
      code but also allows for easier collaboration, readability and further
      improvements to be easily implemented. Since code will be kept with their
      respective parts, changing code only needs to truly change in one area and
      not in many areas. This was one of the many reasons for my revamping
      process.
    </p>
    <p>
      As seen tracked on the GitHub repository, a revamp branch is present. This
      branch was created with the aims of organizing, optimizing and refactoring
      my code, following the end of the Assignment 1 Submission. While working
      on Assignment 2, it became clear that my code was poorly documented and
      ordered. Finding and changing aspects was a nightmare and extremely
      difficult to track. As such, the revamping process aimed at recreating my
      website from scratch, using the previous main branch as a reference and
      design standpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this revamping process, significant changes were implemented. These
      included the wide use of comments used for sorting, describing and
      cleaning up code in a comprehensible way. In my previous submission
      (Assignment 1), changing in screen size and/or rendering the website at
      different resolutions caused visual discrepancies to be present – due to
      the use of exact values. As such, this revamping process took the emphasis
      on focusing on using relative measurements for visual elements, allowing
      for the website to be more dynamic and adapt accordingly. Overall, I would
      like to think that one part of my website that stayed fairly consistent
      was my website's theme, which stayed consistent throughout. Aiming to
      create a minimalistic, professional and clean feel, my website aimed to
      use components that did not have too much going on, having basic
      interactivity, while still being easy to digest, read and interact with.
      Apart from having newer colour overlays, most assets have stayed the same
      and have been carried over from Assignment 1 to Assignment 3 (Exam).
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the use of JavaScript, HTML templates have been created for
      consistent data prevalent throughout all pages. This allows for the
      multiple uses of code to prevent cluttering. This was created in a way to
      replicate that of an OOP Language, focusing on minimizing cluttered code
      and keeping not only the user’s side clean, but the development side as
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding APIs, there are only a few that are currently implemented.
      Looking at the current state of my website, as well as the outlies set, I
      did not find it necessary to have extensive use of different APIs,
      sp[ecifically those provided by third parties. As such, the APIs
      implemented have mainly been used for interactivity on the website.
