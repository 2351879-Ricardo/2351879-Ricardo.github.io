          Working on the finetuning of the website, specifically focusing on the
          aesthetics and readability, the first component to investigate is the
          font – specifically the font family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Font families are split into two main distinct types: serif and
          sans-serif. Despite the purpose of the creation of serif fonts, since
          it was originally made for low-resolution monitors, these would be
          more readable. However, with modern technology, it is better to have
          sans-serif fonts. [1]
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking this into consideration as well as finding the variation I
          found easiest to read, I have settled for Helvetica.
        </p>
        <p>
          After receiving feedback that the font was a bit too small to read, I
          simply opted for increasing the size by an amount that wasn’t too
          large, however, made it easier to see. This was based on my own
          experience, settling for a 25% increase, resulting in the base being
          1.25rem.
        </p>

          Doing research into APIs, it turns out that I had unironically already
          added an API. This consisted of the XMLHttpRequest module, an API in
          the form of objects which focuses on the transfer of data between HTML
          and JavaScript, allowing for communication between backend and
          frontend. [2]
        </p>
        <p>
          This was an obvious choice as it had already been part of the browser
          and did not require any extra libraries to be downloaded, allowing for
          me to easily work with templates and use it as a way to create an
          injection that would be responsible for providing a consistent set of
          information on the sight. This was extremely useful as my entire
          information blocks are dependent on this concept, as well as my
          navigation bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          A variation that could have been used in the Fetch API [3], is
          included in the Ajax library. While Ajax is used widely (even though I
          have used it before), I decided to still opt for the XMLHttpRequest as
          it was already included and did not require the use of importing
          different APIs. I am also not too familiar with JSON (which is the
          primary communication language for Ajax) and I just wanted to get a
          working result due to time limits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another API is also present; however, this is something that Is
          automatically written by Unity when creating an OpenGL game for the
          web.

          After trying different types of layouts, I have finally reached one
          that I am comfortable with. This was the design that was used in
          Assignment 2, however, was not documented.
        </p>
        <p>
          This design choice was to create a simplistic and minimalistic feel to
          the site. Having easy controls to both interact with as well and
          visually understand, this approach aims to minimize extravagancies and
          keep it as clean and professional as possible.
        </p>
        <p>As such, below are the wireframes that are being implemented.</p>
