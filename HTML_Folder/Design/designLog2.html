          While my original navigation bar wasn’t terrible, there were obvious
          problems with it. As mentioned in my blog ‘Analysis of my UI & UX’,
          important factors such as the ‘Norman Door’, general conventions, as
          well as Fitts’ law were not taken into account. As such, development
          on revamping the navigation bar started with research regarding these
          topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting with convention, the obvious choice was to change the links
          between pages from a linkable text (‘a’ tag) to that of a button. This
          would not allow for it to stick with convention but would also allow
          the user to navigate without having to click specifically on the text.
          Buttons were then linked with code using JavaScript, which took
          relative path information to the link between pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The navigation bar was also given a fixed position to compensate for
          when information areas (such as blogs) are expanded and require the
          page to be scrolled through to see all information. Through this
          usage, the navigation bar will remain consistent throughout the page,
          limiting distortion and unwanted effects. A notable problem currently
          found is that the text in the navigation bar seems to not be centered
          when the scrollbar appears. This is due to the scrollbar covering some
          parts of the navigation bar and will require work in the active
          future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another core change was the view style of the navigation bar.
          Previously, the bar navigation bar could be found at the top of the
          page, followed by an expandable menu when the browser was resized
          smaller. During the resizing process, some unwanted effects would
          appear with the navigation bar regarding styling and start creating
          viewing problems. As such, the choice to create a permanent sidebar
          was opted for as it would allow for easier resizing through the use of
          grids and created easier and more predictable outcomes when resizing.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript was also used, alongside an HTML template for the
          navigation bar, which imports the navigation bar onto the active
          webpage when required. Reasonings for this are discussed in the
          ‘JavaScript Injections for HTML Templates’ section.

          <h2>Information Blocks</h2>

      </header>

      <article class="collapse-content">
        <p>
          Originally created to store the blogs, information blocks now serve as
          the primary way of populating information on the webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information blocks consist of a header section in which a title and
          any other relevant information are displayed for the information to
          follow. The second part of the information block serves as the body
          and contains the information relevant to the title aforementioned
        </p>
        <p>
          Collapsible functionality was built into information blocks to
          compensate for the minimalistic, clean feel of the website. It also
          serves as a way for users to view information as they please, and
          allows for easier navigation among multiple information blocks on a
          single page. Throughout his process, the user can choose which
          information can be displayed by them, while still allowing them to
          collapse said information and navigate the rest of the page without it
          feeling cluttered. This is aimed to allow the user to navigate through
          the page with greater ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          The collapsible feature has been in consideration since the early
          stages of the website but proved even more necessary after the first
          version of the website, in which webpages contained lots of
          information and gave the user difficulties when trying to navigate
          through it as well as when trying to locater specific information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current structure of the information blocks has been chosen as it
          (aims to) provides the user with more manageable chunks of
          information, and easier navigation as well as give a clean and
          minimalistic functionality and feel for the component.

          Extensive use of JavaScript code was used to allow for JavaScript
          injections of HTML templates into the desired webpages. This design
          choice was mainly implemented for two specific reasons, that being
          modularity as well as keeping code clean. The use of the JavaScript
          injection allows for conceptually repeated code to be easily
          implemented on new pages and HTML files with relative ease (just by
          using an ID), preventing code from becoming cluttered and keeping code
          sectioned off appropriately to improve readability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system is currently in use for populating pages with information
          in their respective information blocks as well as the navigation bar.
          While this method has proved extremely useful and convenient, there is
          currently an underlying bug that can confuse. Currently, when
          navigating to a page, there is a chance that the information blocks
          are not rendered in the correct order. Reasons for this are still
          currently unknown and will require further research, troubleshooting,
          and debugging.

          Greater focus was spent on enhancing the user experience while on the
          website. These are accounted for in the previously aforementioned
          information blocks and navigation bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another core focus was on interactivity regarding the website,
          providing users with the appropriate information needed for navigating
          the site, as well as giving the user a more pleasant and easier to
          understand the experience. This can be seen in effect in the
          information blocks as well as the navigation bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding the information blocks, users are provided information when
          hovering over the header section of the information block. This
          consists of the changing of both the color of the header as well the
          appearance of the cursor. The purpose of this is to inform the user
          that this is interactable and will result in the expansion and
          collapsing of the information block. In practice, I am not sure if
          this is made entirely apparent and as such, I await feedback regarding
          this. If this is not sufficient, development has already begun a
          background art for the headers, in which text saying “Click Me!” will
          be visible, providing a more direct approach to expressing how the
          element works to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding the navigation bar, the effort was expended to create more
          obvious feedback to the user as to which page they currently are
          viewing. This was implemented as feedback from a user who stated that
          even though the bolding and text change to indicate the current page
          was useful, it wasn’t always apparent and the user would often forget
          which page they were on. As such, the use of complementary color
          change was implemented to create a stark contrast to tabs on the
          navigation bar, proving to be a lot better to comprehend.
        </p>
        <p>
          A current worry I currently have is that of the layout of the
          information blocks that only contain a title (and don’t contain extra
          information as seen in the blogs), as I am not sure if the spacing
          between the elements as well as the sizing is appropriate with Fitts’
          Law. Changes to these variants in information blocks will be reliant
          on feedback received from users.

          As mentioned previously, slight unwanted behavior occurred during
          changes in the browser’s sizing and compatibility with other devices.
          While this was a factor of many poor design choices, it was also a
          result of inconsistent styling in the CSS code. This inconsistent
          styling as a result of trying to use both relative and exact sizing
          measurements synonymously, which caused said unwanted behavior when
          sizing. As such, the entire CSS styling code was rewritten to allow
          for easier and cleaner behavior when resizing, as well as keeping
          convention consistent as per better programming practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Uses of comments can be found through the majority of code scripts in
          which a lot of information would reside. This allows for easier
          readability which will allow for easier expansion in the future as
          well as the ability to be able to see which parts of code are
          responsible for their implementation. This also proved extremely
          useful with the combination of templates. It also allowed for
          JavaScript injections to be implemented with ease due to the
          reformatting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other inconsistencies, such as the varying types of naming classes,
          elements, ids, etc, were also changed to create a consistent and
          easier system to work with. This was done by keeping naming
          conventions consistent. With regards to the current naming system,
          there is active consideration for the process of varying naming
          conventions according to their properties, as only one naming system
          is currently in effect and may cause confusion when working with
          varying properties of elements. Examples of these include variations
          in the naming conventions for element class versus element ids.
        </p>
        <p>
          More time was also spent focusing on the semantic development of the
          website. While there are currently no microformats (although these are
          planned for the foreseeable future), the use of more specific tags
          such as 'figure' and 'figcaption' have been implemented to compensate
          for web crawlers and the SEOs.
