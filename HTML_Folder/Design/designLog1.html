          The idea behind this website was to create an interactive page that
          has a simplistic, minimalistic feel to it, where information is
          expandable and retractive sections. This way all information on the
          relative pages is completely accessible at any stage, but still has
          the functionality to be compressed into a smaller whole, making it
          easier to navigate.
        </p>
        <p>
          These ideas can be conveyed in the form of basic wireframes as seen
          below.

          Considering the idea of sectioning information into minimalistic feel,
          the navigation bar contains information and links only necessary. This
          contains the different pages that will be accessible to the user, with
          basic and minimalistic UI.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the wireframe image below, two alternative views for the navigation
          bar can be seen. The second image will be later touched upon in
          accessibility, as it is a design for a smaller-screened device. The
          colours implemented in the wireframe are not design colours but rather
          a planning for HTML elements and how they will be presented,
          compensating for aspects such as padding, margins, different nested
          elements, etc.

          In the wireframe below, is the initial idea and structure for a blog.
          Upon further development, this styling would be used for all
          information sections throughout the website, albeit having a few
          changes and modifications. The idea of this is to keep the website
          presented as consisted as possible, while still providing a sectioned
          and minimalistic feel to the information presented.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again, like the wireframes above, the colours rather pertain to
          the layout of elements and awareness for spacing, rather than actual
          design choices regarding colours.

          Staying on the idea of the minimalistic theme, I decided to go with a
          simplistic navigation bar at the top of the screen. This composed of
          the different accessible pages. To differentiate from the other pages,
          the current page would have the title text bolded and in all-caps,
          whereas the other pages would be in small caps and be in a regular
          styled font.

          The idea is to have an accessible website which can still be displayed
          well using monitors and devices with different screen sizes –
          including that specifically of mobile. As such, a popup bar replaces
          the navbar, which allows for a different view of the nav bar.

          The website has a good framework that it is currently built on. Going
          forth from this assignment, the aim is to investigate if my semantic
          markup has been correctly implemented. There is also currently the
          fact that as more information is added on pages, the webpage will
          become quite lengthy. The aim to accommodate this is to use JavaScript
          as to make each article section into an expandable and retractable
          block.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also the slight symmetrical error in which when resizing the
          browser, the bottom margin and top margin seem different. This will be
          later alleviated with a jQuery.
