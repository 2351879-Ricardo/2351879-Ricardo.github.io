          <h1>What Is HyperText?</h1>
          <p>
            In this reading, the writer explores, both conceptually and
            literally, the meaning of hypertext. Throughout the reading the
            writer expresses multiple varying definitions to already existing
            defined terms for hypertext. It also here that he mentions hypertext
            as something that is built upon the understanding of its history.
