        <article>
          <p>
            The idea behind this website was to create an interactive page that
            has a simplistic, minimalistic feel to it, where information is
            expandable and retractive sections. This way all information on the
            relative pages is completely accessible at any stage, but still has
            the functionality to be compressed into a smaller whole, making it
            easier to navigate.
          </p>
          <p>
            These ideas can be conveyed in the form of basic wireframes as seen
            below.
          </p>

      <!--WIREFRAMES-->
      <section class="section_post">
        <header>
          <h1>Wireframes</h1>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Considering the idea of sectioning information into minimalistic
            feel, the navigation bar contains information and links only
            necessary. This contains the different pages that will be accessible
            to the user, with basic and minimalistic UI.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the wireframe image below, two alternative views for the
            navigation bar can be seen. The second image will be later touched
            upon in accessibility, as it is a design for a smaller-screened
            device. The colours implemented in the wireframe are not design
            colours but rather a planning for HTML elements and how they will be
            presented, compensating for aspects such as padding, margins,
            different nested elements, etc.
          </p>
          <section class="image_line">
            <img src="/Art Folder/Nav Bar Basic.jpg" alt="" />
            <img src="/Art Folder/Nav Bar Mobile (Extended).jpg" alt="" />
          </section>
          <p>
            In the wireframe below, is the initial idea and structure for a
            blog. Upon further development, this styling would be used for all
            information sections throughout the website, albeit having a few
            changes and modifications. The idea of this is to keep the website
            presented as consisted as possible, while still providing a
            sectioned and minimalistic feel to the information presented.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once again, like the wireframes above, the colours rather pertain to
            the layout of elements and awareness for spacing, rather than actual
            design choices regarding colours.

      <!--NAVIGATION-->
      <section class="section_post">
        <header>
          <h1>Navigation</h1>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Staying on the idea of the minimalistic theme, I decided to go with
            a simplistic navigation bar at the top of the screen. This composed
            of the different accessible pages. To differentiate from the other
            pages, the current page would have the title text bolded and in
            all-caps, whereas the other pages would be in small caps and be in a
            regular styled font.
          </p>

      <!--ACCESSIBILTY-->
      <section class="section_post">
        <header>
          <h1>Accessibility</h1>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The idea is to have an accessible website which can still be
            displayed well using monitors and devices with different screen
            sizes â€“ including that specifically of mobile. As such, a popup bar
            replaces the navbar, which allows for a different view of the nav
            bar.
          </p>

      <!--ASSIGNMENT 1 - REFLECTION-->
      <section class="section_post">
        <header>
          <h1>Assignment 1 - Reflection</h1>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The website has a good framework that it is currently built on.
            Going forth from this assignment, the aim is to investigate if my
            semantic markup has been correctly implemented. There is also
            currently the fact that as more information is added on pages, the
            webpage will become quite lengthy. The aim to accommodate this is to
            use JavaScript as to make each article section into an expandable
            and retractable block.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also the slight symmetrical error in which when resizing
            the browser, the bottom margin and top margin seem different. This
            will be later alleviated with a jQuery.
