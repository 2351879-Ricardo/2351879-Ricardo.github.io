          <h1>What is HyperText?</h1>

          <h1>What is HyperText?</h1>
          <p>
            In this reading, the writer explores, both conceptually and
            literally, the meaning of hypertext. Throughout the reading the
            writer expresses multiple varying definitions to already existing
            defined terms for hypertext. It also here that he mentions hypertext
            as something that is built upon the understanding of its history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like the questions of “What is communism”, “What is natural
            selection” and many more of such thought, definitions seem to vary
            according to who you ask. When approaching this thought, my mind
            wanders to that of the question, “What is a game?”, a question often
            discussed, debated, and differently defined within the Game Design
            community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence, I believe (that much like the definition of a “game”), the
            definition is something that is relative to the speaker, the
            interpreter, and the context of the situation in which it is being
            used. An example would be request of a hyperlink for a website, in
            which the literal text is requested. This varies to the definition
            of a hyperlink regarding the media and the entire concept behind it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than defining hypertext as one definition, I feel it is
            important to rather explore the multiple variations in the
            definition, as possibly create multiple definitions (based on
            context). Like words in the English language, words can have
            multiple meanings, only really being able to be fully understood
            when used in a sentence that provides context.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later in the text, a definition for hypermedia is quoted from
            Nelson. Here it is described as a branching form of presenting media
            to the user in a way that is controlled by the user’s actions (with
            hypertext being a subclass of hypermedia). Described as media,
            Nelson tries to remove the thought of hypermedia being a static form
            of information, but rather an interactive form of information that
            is designed, like that of other media.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also mentioned in the reading that much like previously coined
            terms, such as "communism" and the like, the definition and idea was
            based on a certain way of thinking of a particular person. This
            further cements my point of it being relative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using communism as an example, people often define communism in two
            ways: the way in which communism is currently implemented in the
            world, or rather the ideal, predefined concept of what communism
            should be. Both of these have large variations in the definition as
            the concept of "communism" has been skewed from the actual
            definition itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, I don’t feel and believe that hypertext should be defined
            by a single term, but rather be seen as a form of media, varying
            with different interpretations and definitions, based on the users
            view of it.
