          <h1>What Is HyperText?</h1>
          <h2>Ricardo Costa-Tré</h2>

          <h1>What Is HyperText?</h1>
          <p>
            In this reading, the writer explores, both conceptually and
            literally, the meaning of hypertext. Throughout the reading the
            writer expresses multiple varying definitions to already existing
            defined terms for hypertext. It also here that he mentions hypertext
            as something that is built upon the understanding of its history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like the questions of “What is communism”, “What is natural
            selection” and many more of such thought, definitions seem to vary
            according to who you ask. When approaching this thought, my mind
            wanders to that of the question, “What is a game?”, a question often
            discussed, debated, and differently defined within the Game Design
            community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence, I believe (that much like the definition of a “game”), the
            definition is something that is relative to the speaker, the
            interpreter, and the context of the situation in which it is being
            used. An example would be request of a hyperlink for a website, in
            which the literal text is requested. This varies to the definition
            of a hyperlink regarding the media and the entire concept behind it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than defining hypertext as one definition, I feel it is
            important to rather explore the multiple variations in the
            definition, as possibly create multiple definitions (based on
            context). Like words in the English language, words can have
            multiple meanings, only really being able to be fully understood
            when used in a sentence that provides context.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later in the text, a definition for hypermedia is quoted from
            Nelson. Here it is described as a branching form of presenting media
            to the user in a way that is controlled by the user’s actions (with
            hypertext being a subclass of hypermedia). Described as media,
            Nelson tries to remove the thought of hypermedia being a static form
            of information, but rather an interactive form of information that
            is designed, like that of other media.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also mentioned in the reading that much like previously coined
            terms, such as "communism" and the like, the definition and idea was
            based on a certain way of thinking of a particular person. This
            further cements my point of it being relative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using communism as an example, people often define communism in two
            ways: the way in which communism is currently implemented in the
            world, or rather the ideal, predefined concept of what communism
            should be. Both of these have large variations in the definition as
            the concept of "communism" has been skewed from the actual
            definition itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, I don’t feel and believe that hypertext should be defined
            by a single term, but rather be seen as a form of media, varying
            with different interpretations and definitions, based on the users
            view of it.

          <h1>What Is A Browser</h1>

          <h1>What Is A Browser</h1>
          <p>
            Simply put, a browser is a piece of software. This software is used
            as a medium for displaying information from the web. There are many
            different browsers, each offering slight differences and quirks, but
            at the end of the day, they all do the same thing - display
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Web Browser is responsible for taking in user input (for what
            the user is looking for) and displaying information regarding said
            input. The information displayed is dependent on the URL, which is a
            unique identifier for a webpage. This URL is used as a reference to
            know where to pull data from and what to display. Through the use of
            web-programming languages, the browser then displays the information
            requested by the code, loading in details such as text, images and
            possibly other hyperlinks.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the most basic and unexplained terms, it is a form of software
            that is responsible for gathering information from other parts of
            the web and displaying it a way such that it is consumable by the
            user.

      <!--BLOG POST 3: INTERACTIVITY-->
      <section class="section_post">
        <header>
          <h1>What Interactivity Means On The WWW</h1>
          <h2>Ricardo Costa-Tré</h2>
          <h2>15 April 2022</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
          <h1>What Interactivity Means On The WWW</h1>
          <h2>The Development of the Web</h2>
          <p>
            With Web development, from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0, interactivity became
            a huge factor in developing, considering, and using web design. This
            development was the first transition from static, read-only
            websites, to a more dynamic, user-varied, read-write form of
            providing and receiving information. However, it did not stop there.
            Web 3.0 is the idea of having the web analyzed according to user
            data. Content searched, links clicked, and the navigation between
            different places on the web is used to directly affect how
            information is provided to the user on the internet. In the rawest
            and basic form, this can be seen on websites such as YouTube,
            Twitch, and most social media platforms in which the SEO is used to
            gather information (on common topics, people, etc.) which is run
            through an algorithm that filters through content to give out
            recommended content that the user may enjoy.
          </p>
          <p>
            While it may not seem very interactable on the surface, the entire
            search algorithm and the filtering of content are based on our
            preferences, likes, and commonly searched topics. This itself is a
            form of input that is reliant on the user and is not completely the
            same for one person.
          </p>
          <p>
            The development of Web 3.0, also brings along the ethical problems
            such as gathering user information that may be considered private
            and having it used for commercial uses. This problem has already
            arisen multiple times in the past, as seen with many scandals from
            Facebook regarding user information.
          </p>
          <h2>Why Is Interactivity Important for the WWW?</h2>
          <p>
            As mentioned above, the main focus of interactivity is receiving an
            input from a user and displaying an output that is customized in a
            way such that it is preferable for said user. With the advancements
            in technology and how we receive, perceive, and share information
            across the web, the amount of information found and stored on the
            web is constantly increasing at a drastic speed. As such, one cannot
            be expected to read and have to filter through all this information,
            as nothing would actually be done. As such, user input is essential
            in minimizing the need to find valid sources and information that
            the user is interested in. This is the core principle for
            interactivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The web is constantly evolving in such a way to make life easier for
            the consumer by providing recommendations on the user's taste, and
            as such websites aim to make their websites interactive, not only
            for displaying products, but also to provide a quick and easy
            experience for the user - an essential thing to have in a fast
            moving environment (as people will tend to click off and find
            another site if the current website is too jarring).
